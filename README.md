    #Title:
     Node readme creator
    ##Description:
    I was motivated to make this project to help simplify the process of making a readme doc
    This project was made as a time saver to help free up essential time. 
    This project solves a very needed problem of mine where I spend to much time creating a new readme doc everytime I make a new repo on github
    I learned a significant amount about node.js and inquirer when working on this project
    ##Installation:
    To install and use this project you will need node.js and inquirer npm in order to get this to work
    ##Usage:
    Once inquirer and node.js are installed open VScode and right click, open terminal. Type "node index.js" press enter and the questions will launch. Simply answer the questions. If you would like to have the file saved somewhere other than my chosen path you must put that in on line 107. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dnJ3p6KN6bkZASs3166vwsarYCVns7Mn/view
    ##Credits:
    For this project I used Udemy.com and https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer to reasearch how to accomplish this task.
